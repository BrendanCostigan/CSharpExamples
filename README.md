# Exam 70-483 - Programming in C Sharp

Some people seem to find taking Microsoft Exams very simple, I do not. For each exam, I find a suitable book as a guide to the syllabus and then work through examples from the book, MSDN or other web pages. The book I used to guide me through this exam was 'Exam Ref 70-483 Programming in C#' by Wouter de Kort. Worth a read if you are going for the exam.

This repository contains sample C# code that I used to prepare for the exam.
